# Quick start

Here we will go through each step from the raw signals file (slow5) to generating plots.

For this we will use `r9.4_450bps.nucleotide` DNA dataset. The dataset is at `test/data/raw/pipelines/pipeline_0/r9.4_450bps.nucleotide`.
Each step listed in the bash script `run.sh` is discussed below.
